# California Housing Prediction

This repo contains a Colab-ready Jupyter notebook and the `housing.csv` dataset for predicting California house prices.

Files:
- `Calif_Housing_Prediction.ipynb` — Notebook with EDA, preprocessing, model training (Linear Regression & Random Forest), evaluation, and saved model.
- `housing.csv` — Dataset.

How to run:
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab (File → Upload notebook).
2. Run all cells. The dataset is expected in the same folder path `/mnt/data/housing.csv` when running here, but in Colab you can upload `housing.csv` using the UI or mount Google Drive.
